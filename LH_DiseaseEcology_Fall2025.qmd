Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence in 95%. n=59
2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
    -   95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population n=299

    -   99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population n=228

        A disease with lower prevalence will require a higher sample size than a disease with higher prevalence, even with the increased CI.
3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \< 1%.
