## 9/15/2025 Worksheet 2

Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence in 95%. n=59

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    -   95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population n=299

    -   99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population n=228

        A disease with lower prevalence will require a higher sample size than a disease with higher prevalence, even with the increased CI.

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \< 1%.

**1**. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect:              (**12 points**)

a\. Compared to macroparasites, microparasites have a shorter generation time and do not reproduce within the host.

**False, microparasites have a high rate of reproduction within the host.**

b\. Using disease models, we can make accurate predictions of how a disease will spread in a real-world host population. 

**False, models cannot predict with certainty**

c\. Chagas disease is a protozoal disease that is commonly transmitted by the triatomine bug (Kissing bug). It can also be transmitted by consumption of contaminated food or beverages (feces of infected triatomine bugs). Chagas disease is therefore a contagious disease.

**False, it is infectious**

d\. Epizootic Hemorrhagic disease always causes severe outbreaks in white-trailed deer populations across the US, resulting in high mortalities. 

**False, there is low mortality in the southeast and more severe in the north.**

e\. White-tailed deer infected with brain worm (*Parelophostrongylus tenuis*) rarely exhibit any symptoms or clinical signs. But infected white-tailed deer pass infectious larvae through their feces. White-tailed deer with brain worms can therefore be described as infected, diseased and infectious. 

**False, the host passes larvae through feces, it is infected but not diseased.**

f\. The deer mouse (*Peromyscus maniculatus*) infected with Sin Nombre Virus do not show any clinical signs, but excrete the virus in their urine, feces and saliva. Humans get infected via aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent. The illness caused by Sin Nombre virus in humans is called Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). HPS is therefore a vector-transmitted disease.

False, it is zoonotic but not vector transmitted.

2\. Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease: Prevalence and incidence.   (**5 points**) 

Prevalence measures the number of infected animals as a proportion of the total population to tell you how many animals have the disease at a certain point in time. Incidence only considers the number of new cases in reference to the number of susceptible hosts at a certain point in time, it measures risk.  

3\. Match the following                                                                (**6 points**)

1.  Blackhead disease e. Disease caused by protozoa
2.  A pathogen invading host tissues a. Infection
3.  Brain worm in white-tailed deer c. Brain worm infection in moose
4.  β f. effective contact rate
5.  Rabbit hemorrhagic disease d. Disease caused by virus
6.  White nose syndrome
7.  Disease b. Signs of illness

4\. Moose can get infected by consuming a gastropod infected with *Parelaphostrongylus tenuis* larvae. Infected moose exhibit clinical signs like weakness, incoordination, circling, paralysis, and eventual death. But moose are unable to propagate the parasite. Such hosts are called [dead end hosts]{.underline}.        (**2 points**)

5\.

a\) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Measles. Average infectious period for measles is 8 days.                                                                       (**2 points**) 

 γ = 1/8 or 0.125/day

b) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Rotavirus. Average infectious period for Rotavirus is 1-3 weeks, average of 2 weeks.                                              (**2 points**) 

γ = 1/2 or 0.5/week

c\) The R~0~ for measles is estimated at 15 and 17 for rotavirus. Calculate β for both diseases.                                                                         (**2 points**) 

Measles: 15 = β / 0.125    β = 1.875

Rotavirus: 17 =  β /0.5       β = 8.5

d\) Calculate R~eff~ for a measles outbreak in a population with 80% measles vaccination coverage.                                                                              (**3 points**) 

0.8 = 1/R   Reff= 1.25

6\. For any transmissible disease, which of the following host states are possible? (**6 points**)

1.  Infected but not diseased

When a host is infected but not diseased, it is a carrier. An example of this is tuberculosis in humans.

2.  Infected and diseased

It is common for infected hosts to also be diseased. An example of this is COVID 19.

3.  Not infected but diseased

Not possible, the pathogen must invade (infect) the host to cause disease.

For each state, explain your reasoning and support your answer with at least one example from human or wildlife disease systems. If you believe a particular state is *not possible*, justify why with clear reasoning.

7\. Estimate the incubation period for Campylobacteriosis and Norovirus gastroenteritis from the following Epidemic curves.                                                 (**4 points**)

Campylobacter: 4 days

Norovirus: 48 hours

8\. In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.                                                                   (20 points)

The pathogen causing these mass mortality events in the Saiga antelope is a commensal bacteria in the nasal passage. This mainly effects females in calving aggregations that are already stressed. Under high temperature and humidity conditions, this leads to acute hemorrhagic septicemia and mass mortality. Since the bacteria is commensal, not much can be done in terms of elimination of the pathogen or vaccination of the host. Since females birth large calve, and often two at a time, the population is able to recover from these events. However, conservation strategies like reducing hunting threats or other disease threats can allow the population to better recover from this specific event.

9\. In his 1933 book *Game Management*, Aldo Leopold dedicated a chapter to wildlife diseases, stating that wildlife disease is primarily an ecological issue driven largely by human actions. Do you agree with this perspective? Explain your reasoning, using at least two examples from wildlife disease systems to support your answer.                                          (6 points)

In many cases, human interactions can alter the impacts of a wildlife disease. In cases like the Saiga antelope, the disease is not caused by humans, but adding other human threats to the pressure of these MMEs can cause stress on the population and make it harder for them to recover. Another case of humans influencing wildlife disease is white nose syndrome in bats. Which is an epizootic disease believed to be introduced by humans. Although humans may not always directly affect the wildlife disease dynamic, human interactions often influence severity and recovery.

10\. Define R~0~. Estimate R~0~ for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents an infectious case, and blue are susceptible; an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world utility of R~0~.                                                                         (**10 points**)

R0  is the average number of hosts infected by one case. R0 = 1.5

(0+1+2+3)/4

11\. Steve studies a population of the Suwannee Alligator Snapping turtle (*Macrochelys suwanniensis*) in Florida. He has been conducting a mark-recapture study of this population since 2010.  Since 2015, he has documented cases of cutaneous fibroma in this population. The following data was collected by Steve:

a) Which year has the highest incidence of turtle fibroma? Make sure you write appropriate unit for the incidence value.  Show your work.                                                    (**5 points**) 

2017: 8/108 = 0.074 cases/turtle-year

b) When is the prevalence lowest? When is the prevalence highest? Write unit for prevalence if applicable.                                                                          (**5 points**) 

\
Prevalence was highest in 2017: 12/112 = 10.71%

Prevalence was lowest in 2015: 4/133 = 3.0075%

12\. The Dutch harbor seal population is estimated to be around 5400 with \~50% adults. Seals are susceptible to phocine distemper virus (PDV), but an estimated 40% of the adults in this population are immune to PDV by virtue of prior natural infection. How many seals in this population should be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity sufficient to prevent an outbreak of PDV in this population if the R0 is estimated to be \~3? Assume that all the adult seals that have survived prior PDV infection are tagged, and hence identifiable.                                             (10 points) 

1 - 1/3 = 0.66 66% should be vaccinated

2700 adults –\> 1,620 susceptible \* 0.66 = 1,069 individuals should be vaccinated

## 10/23/2025 Worksheet 4

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (3 points)

    Incorrect, it is maintained in camels and invades humans but cannot be sustained.

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (3 points)

    Correct

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (3 points)

    Incorrect, there is some transmission between humans

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately\
    65%. (3 points)

    Incorrect, 35% case fatality rate

5.  The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak. (3 points)

    Incorrect, there are multiple peaks

6.  Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this\
    decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral\
    factors that may have contributed to this trend. (5 points)

Ecological shifts could cause a shift in the animal reservoir for MERS-CoV, potentially reducing spillover. Epidemiologically, increased awareness, detection, and isolation could contribute to a reduction in healthcare associated outbreaks. Most notably, there were many behavioral changes due to COVID 19 that could have contributed to a decline, for example, wearing masks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

11/3/2025 Worksheet 5

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,\
    would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging\
    infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points

    This would be classified as an emerging infectious disease. The between species rate is low, in this case, a single transmission event. The disease is sustained in H2, humans, in hospital settings.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both\
    community and healthcare settings? 5 points

    Early detection and rapid isolation are the most effective strategies for reducing the risk of transmission. Community education helps people recognize symptoms, seek care quickly, and use safe caregiving practices. Clear communication and local engagement build trust, which encourages early reporting and supports containment efforts in both community and healthcare settings.

## 11/16/2025 Worksheet 7

Nipah Virus\
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting. 8 points

In Malaysia, Nipah virus is transmitted from bats to pigs to humans. In Bangladesh, Nipah virus is transmitted from bats to humans through date palms. Preventative measures focus on blocking the specific pathways which differ between regions. In Malaysia, managing pig farms and pig health is the best way to prevent spillover. In Bangladesh, pigs are not involved in the mode of transmission. Avoiding raw sap and preventing bats from reaching palm sap are the best ways to manage spillover.

Avian Reovirus\
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population. 6 points\

ARV is transmitted from contaminated feed or water to chickens as vertical transmission. It is transmitted from chicken to chicken through horizontal transmission. Environmental factors like poor hygiene and overcrowding increase transmission. ARVs non enveloped capsid allows for increased vertical transmission as the virus can survive for longer periods of time in the environment. ARV outbreaks have occurred in wild turkey populations. This can cause lameness and decreased ability to escape predation leading to declines in local populations.

Langya henipavirus\
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? 6 points

The likey resovior for LayV is shrews and the virus is spread through direct or indirect contact with infected animals. Human to human transmission has not been confirmed, therefore, this cannot be an EID. It is classified as a spillover because transmission is from animal to human.

The prevalence of B. procyonis in the central region is 64.3% (37.1 - 84.7; 95% C.L.). The prevalence of B. procyonis in the north region is 28.6% (17.0 - 42.8; 95% C.L.). The prevalence of B. procyonis in the south region is 62.8% (47.7 - 75.9; 95% C.L.).

The overall prevalence of B. procyonis is 64.9% (48.6 - 78.6; 95% C.I.) in females and 37.7% (26.7 - 50.0; 95% C.L.) in males.

In the central region, the prevalence of B. procyonis is 100.0% (50.0 - 100.0; 95% C.L.) and 37.5% (11.1 - 71.1) in males. . There was no significant difference between males and females in the central region (p = 0.0754). In the north, the prevalence of B. procyonis is 22.2% (10.2 - 41.5; 95% C.L.) in males and 35.0% (16.7 - 57.6; 95% C.L) in females. There was no significant difference between males and females in the north (p = 0.5107). In the south, the prevalence of B. procyonis is 100.0% (50.0 - 100.0; 95% C.L.) and 48.8% (31.0 - 66.4; 05% C.L.) in males. There was a significant difference between males and females in the south (p = 0.0032).

## 11/24/2025 Term Paper

To the New York Department of Health,

In 2022, the Mpox epidemic reached the United States, with New York experiencing one of the highest case counts (CDC, 2025). Understanding the characteristics, transmission, and presentation of the virus is essential in providing actionable recommendations in order to help reduce and prevent future outbreaks

**Mpox Virus**

Mpox disease is caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is a double stranded DNA virus similar to smallpox (Moore et al., 2023). However, unlike smallpox, Mpox can persist outside of human hosts in natural wildlife reservoirs. Although mice, rats, squirrels, and pigs can maintain the virus in nature, non-human primates are the primary concern for human exposure (Moore et al., 2023). Mpox is a zoonotic pathogen and can spread both from animals to humans and between humans.

**Transmission of the disease** 

Since Mpox is a zoonotic disease, it can be transmitted from animals to humans, allowing for spillover through non-human primates, like monkeys. This can occur through bites, scratches, or other contact with fluids from an infected host (Moore et al., 2023). This initial transmission route allows the virus to move out of the reservoir species and into the human population which sustains outbreaks outside of endemic regions. 

Once Mpox has been introduced to the human population, the disease can spread through direct human to human contact through respiratory drops and contact with lesions (Moore et al., 2023). This human to human pathway is the main concern for Mpox outbreaks in the United States. 

Historically, outbreaks have been endemic to Central and West Africa where spillover events can occur from Mpox in natural reservoirs (CDC, 2025). The disease was rarely reported outside of Africa until an outbreak in 2022 where a spillover event led to sustained human to human transmission. Eventually through human travel, Mpox was spread to multiple countries, including the United States (CDC, 2025).  

In 2022, the first and largest Mpox outbreak in the United States occurred in New York State (CDC, 2025). Due to New York’s high volume of international travel and dense, urban population, it is at increased risk for emerging infectious diseases like Mpox. 

**Clinical Presentation** 

Mpox infection occurs when a susceptible individual is exposed to the virus by an infected individual. The incubation period of Mpox is 7 to 14 days but can extend up to 21 days (Moore et al., 2023). This is the time between exposure and onset of symptoms where the individual is not yet contagious. This means that the pathogen is present in the host but not transmittable. Symptoms of the prodromal phase include fever, fatigue, headache, and swollen lymph nodes (CDC, 2024). Individuals may be contagious during this phase once the virus has entered the bloodstream, but transmission is more likely after the appearance of the characteristic rash and lesions caused by the virus. Mpox infections typically resolve within 2 to 4 weeks but can last longer and be more severe in immunocompromised individuals (Moore et al., 2023). Understanding these periods is critical for isolation, contact tracing, and preventing transmission of the disease. 

**Recommendations** 

Disease surveillance is essential in non-endemic areas like the United States. In endemic regions of Africa Mpox outbreaks are spillover events, while in the United States Mpox is considered an emerging infectious disease. This is important because methods for preventing disease are different in endemic and non-endemic regions. Understanding this distinction is critical for implementing targeted surveillance, vaccination, and outbreak control measures in the human to human route transmission route.  

Spillover events can only occur in areas where there is a natural reservoir, and the disease can be transmitted from animal to human. Since Mpox is naturally maintained in animals in Central and West Africa, this is not a risk for the United States. The main risk is human to human transmission from travelers returning from the endemic region. Vaccination requirements of travelers will greatly reduce the risk of introduction and subsequent spread through this pathway. However, if the virus does enter the region, multiple strategies can help control transmission, including public education, case management, and infection control in healthcare environments. 

Increased education for more vulnerable groups has the potential to greatly reduce transmission of Mpox in non-endemic regions such as New York. During the most recent outbreak, the virus was primarily spread through sexual contact within specific male populations (Moore et al., 2023). Targeted education to these groups can raise awareness of risk factors and encourage early symptom recognition. This promotes safe practices that will reduce transmission.   

In addition to human travel, there is a potential risk that an imported animal could carry the virus into the region. This can be controlled by monitoring and regulating all imported animals from Central and West Africa. 

Understanding host-pathogen interactions, spillover dynamics, and the role of wildlife reservoirs can help predict and prevent future Mpox emergence in non-endemic regions. By combining targeted surveillance, education, vaccination, and infection control, New York can reduce the risk of both imported cases and sustained human-to-human transmission.

## 11/25/2025 Worksheet 9

1.  In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection. 10 points

    In backyard poultry flocks there is much higher bird human contact rates than in commercial poultry agriculture. Backyard poultry owners typically treat their birds like pets, picking them up and handling them often. Salmonella can be shed from seemingly health birds into the environment through little, soil, and other fomites. This means that humans can acquire salmonella through either direct contact with the bird or indirectly through fomites, eggs, or other environmental reservoirs.

    Backyard flocks are not heavily regulated for vaccines outside of the hatchery. Once the birds are brought home there is no regulatory agency such as the FDA or USDA etc. ensuring updated vaccination on backyard flocks. This causes backyard flocks to be much more vulnerable to outbreaks. Salmonella can exist in small flocks with out symptoms, allowing the pathogen to circulate, increasing the chances for human exposure.

    Finally, there is no waste management in backyard flocks. Backyard poultry owners often do not clean coops frequently and dispose of waste improperly. Waste can commonly be used as fertilizer allowing Salmonella to persist in the soil and potentially be tracked inside through shoes.

2.  Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

    a\. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte? 3 points

    The fungal infection deters grazing insects and reduces damage from herbivore.

    \

    b.  What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 4 points

    The severity of fescue toxicosis is is much higher in dry, warmer temperatures especially with drought stress increasing alkaloid production. The microbial community of the soil affects endophyte activity and therfore effects fescue toxicosis. Lastly, grazing management also influences the accumulation of the toxin and disease risk.

    \

    c.  What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 3 points

    Cattle experience weight loss, decreased feed intake and efficiency, poor growth, and change in core temperature.

## 11/25/2025 Worksheet 10

1.  What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 10 points

    ASF can be vector borne where it is transmitted though ticks which can retain the virus long term. It can also be transmitted directly from pig to pig. Humans play a role in transmission route by potentially spreading ASF through contaminated feed or equipment, however humans can only be mechanical vectors, not biological.

2.  Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas. 10 points

    KoRV is an acquired immunodeficiency virus meaning it suppresses the immune system. This makes chlamydial infections symptomatically worse in koalas with KoRV. Due to a suppressed immune system bacterial loads are higher and they have a reduced ability to fight chlamydia. This causes koalas with co-infections to have higher mortality and infertility rates. A decrease in fertility paired with an increase in mortality leads to a fast population decline. Antibiotics have been the best option for treatment, however, there is a concern for antibiotic resistance. The next option is development of vaccines.

3.  Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD) 10 points

    SFD fungal spores are persistent in the soil where snakes are consistency exposed and eliminating this exposure is not a feasible option. Snakes are also a difficult animal to monitor due to their behaviors and diagnostic testing is inconsistent. PCR is still developing are there are false negatives using the current method. Since disease surveillance is such an important step in disease management, these challenges make it difficult to move forward in SFD control and management.

False, the american robin is considered the superspreader species in North America.

**2. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? (10 points)**

There is no vaccination or treatment which makes community based intervention essential in preventing transmission of th disease. The largest intervention is targeting contaminated water sources by providing water filters and chemical treatments. This is effective because the larval stage of the life cycle occurs in copopods that live in water sources. Humans are required as the definitive host for the worm to reproduce. Therfore, if the worm is prevented from reaching the human host, due to water treatment or filtration, it will not be able to reproduce.

Another way to break the transmission cycle is preventing the larvae from entering water sources. This happens when infected human hosts use water to sooth the burning pain caused by the worm. When this happens the worm releases its eggs into the water. Education programs and better patient treatment programs prevent infected patients from contaminating water sources.

This transmission cycle must be broken for over a year, due to the length of the life cycle, to eradicate the disease. However, in 2015 there was a rise in cases due to infections in dogs. Since dogs are free roaming it is extremely difficult to prevent them from contaminating water sources and makes eradication much more difficult.

**3. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of\
the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the\
main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? (10 points)**

There is no vaccination or treatment for CWD. However, the main challenge for controlling CWD lis the detection of the disease. CWD has a long incubation period, up to 5 years, where infected animals can spread the disease without showing any clinical symptoms. This makes controlling the spread of CWD very difficult because infectious animals cannot be detected. This means that by the time the disease is detected in an environment, it is most likely already established making it difficult to eliminate, even if there was a treatment.

**4. You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required).

• March 2025: 3 infected\
• April 2025: 5 infected\
• May 2025: 5 infected\
• June 2025: 8 infected\
• July 2025: 13 infected\

**5. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.**

**\
a. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? (2 points)**

Tularemia is caused by *Francisella tularensis* subspecies *holartica*.

**\
b. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? (2 points)**

Tularemia is a vector borne disease transmitted by ticks and flies. It can also be transmitted through direct contact from handling infected animals, . inhalation through contaminated aerosols, and ingestion of contaminated water or meat.

**\
c. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/public health. (3 points)**

Humans are a dead end host, so that pathogen cannot be spread from human to human. However, the pathogen can persist in the environment for weeks and has a very low infectious dose. This makes recognition and immediate treatment extremely important. But unlike other diseases, there is no human to human transmission risk so there is no risk of healthcare associated cases in hospital settings. Prevention should be focused on the environmental side of the disease transmission cycle.

**8. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white-tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. (10 points)**

One of the main concerns with this approach is the sampling method where the samples may not be representative of the population. Since the deer were harvested by hunters, the deer killed were not random and subject to hunter bias such as age or sex. Hunters will typically select for larger deer but one of the clinical signs of CWD is weight loss. This could cause an underestimation of prevalence.

**9. Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants. (10 points)**

**\
a. SARS-CoV-2**

Case 4: Potential EID (top left). SARS-CoV-2 has very high within species transmission in humans (H2) but very low between species transmission. The disease can be transmitted from animal (H1) to human (H2) in very rare occasions but the disease spreads through the within species transmission route.

**\
b. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome**

Case 1: Spillover (bottom left). Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome has low within and between species transmission. The disease cannot be transmitted from human to human (H2) and between species transmission, from rodent (H1) to human (H2) is low. **\
**

**c. Langya Henipavirus**

Case 2: Apparent multihost pathogen (bottom right). Langya Henipavirus has low within species transmission and high between species transmission. There have been no cases of secondary infection, human to human (H2) transmission. Langya Henipavirus is maintained in the reservoir species, shrews, which are silent carriers of the disease. The only human infections occur through between species transmission, shrews (H1) to humans (H2).

**\
d. Brucellosis**

Case 3: True multihost pathogen (top right). Brucellosis has high within and between species transmission. It is maintained in multipe host species and can be transmitted between them. The disease can be sustained in cattle, bison, and elk populations. Brucellosis can also be transmitted from wild populations to ranch cattle and then further infect humans through contaminated meat.

**\
e. West Nile virus**

Case 1: Spillover (bottom left) only in the case of humans. West Nile virus has low within and between species transmission. It cannot be transmitted from human to human, H2 transmission. Humans can only be infected by infected mosquitoes which transmit the disease from birds (H1), though transmission rate is still low.

**10. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. (8 points)**

Marine mammals are the definitive host where the adult stage of the worm reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in the stomach. Then the eggs are released through defecation. Crustaceans are the intermediate host where the L3 larvae is developing. Fish and cephalopods are the paratenic host where there is no development but the larvae can be transmitted to marine mammals to further develop. The dead end host in this system is humans because the host can be infected but cannot further transmit the pathogen, and humans are not required for the life cycle.

**11. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. (3 points)**

During the incubation period, an individual can be infected for a period of time before developing clinical signs and symptoms. Given an individual is not diseased until there is a decline in health, this is a case where a host is infected but not diseased. An example of this is the long incubation period associated with CWD which creates serious implications for the spread of the disease.

Disease carriers are infected hosts which shows no signs and therefore are not diseased. For example, chronic carriers of *Salmonella* Typhi who do not experience disease symptoms.

Reservoir species can also be infected with a pathogen without being diseased. Many wildlife reservoirs maintain pathogens without exhibiting disease. For example, rodents infected with hantaviruses or birds infected with West Nile virus.

**12. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? (3 points)**

1 - (1/2.5) = 0.6 60% of the population should be vaccinated

**13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples. (6 points)**

Disease detection is one of the first steps in managing disease, however, this alone is a big challenge for managing wildlife disease. Free ranging wildlife makes it difficult to monitor individuals as there is no routine handling and heavily depends on opportunistic sampling. Additionally, there are many diseases that may not show any clinical signs, like CWD. Migration and movement of animals also allows the pathogen to easily spread through regions and diseases can have multiple hosts, vectors, and reservoirs.
